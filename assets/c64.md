### Commodore C64 extra

Trick modes, you need to experiment with setting to produce decent picture. Noise dithering works very well with MCI, bayer with Interlaced Hires.

MCI try to avoid pictures with big empty areas.

Converter mode

* Hires interlaced - 3 colors in a cell 8x8
* Multicolor interlaced - 8 colors in a cell 8x8
* Monochrome - reduce colors to 21 shades of gray

Color aproximation for hires interlaced

* linear - most distant colors in RGB cube, preferred
* cube - cube color approximation, more accurate

Flickering for multicolor interlaced (MCI) - eliminate picture flashing.

luma threshold - how far apart can be the brightness of used colors.
